# covid19

The main code retireves the time series stored in the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Dataset (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data) for a small selection of countries. Then it rearranges the data and create some informative plots.

I put as a reference number the fatality rate from influenza (total population and only hospitalized) published by Robert Koch Institute for the year 2018 (before COVID 19 outbreak).

Some data are normalized by million population by country. I took the data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info).
